## pyspark ML adventures
In this repo i may upload a few pyspark/GPU excursions.
### Titanic
The Titanic notebook gives you a pyspark framework with which to expand on regarding your Spark/ML projects. I recently bought a FiercePC with a Nvidia RTX 2060 6GB GPU in it, which comes with cuda cores for rapid algorithm crunching. It's also a beginner gaming PC i suppose:). Anyway i thought i would test out the capabilities on some models, the Titanic dataset is the first one im testing on. I didnt bother much with feature engineering just yet, was aiming to get the framework done which ive largely acheived. I might do some going forward though, so watch this space.
