pyspark ML adventures

In this repo i may upload a few pyspark/GPU excursions. The Titanic one gives you a pyspark framework with which to expand on regarding your Spark/ML projects. I recently bought a FiercePC with a Nvidia RTX 2060 6GB GPU in it, which comes with cuda cores for rapid algorithm crunching. It's also a beginner gaming PC i suppose:). Anyway i thought i would test out the capabilities on some models.
